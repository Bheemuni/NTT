This project is organized as three parts: 
(1) hardware codes for radix-2 and radix-4 NTT/INTT kernels written in Verilog HDL; 
(2) algorithm models for radix-2 and radix-4 NTT/INTT  written in Python;
(3) resource usages broken down across different modules tailored for radix-2 and radix-4 NTT kernels with different number of BFUs, which is reported by Vivado 2020.2 on Windows 10 using Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA (xc7vx690tffg1761-3);
